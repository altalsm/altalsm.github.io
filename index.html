<p> I love travelling and exploring new places! When I turned 18, 
I quickly moved away from Ontario and my hometown. I moved to Edmonton where I lived for 7 years. While living out west 
	I spent a lot of time travelling around the mountains exploring new hiking trails and hiking different ridges. 
	My favorite areas to camp and relax include Kananaskis and Nordegg, travelling off old logging roads on public 
	land are some of the best hidden gems away from the hustle and bustle of Banff and Jasper. I have also taken many 
	trips throughout British Columbia including places like Dawson Creek, Kelowna, Kamloops, Vancouver, Victoria, and 
	Tofino. After driving from Alberta to Ontario 6 times in the 7 years living out west, I have had the opportunity 
	of seeing and stopping in many cities on the prairies. 

Recently on my journey across Canada I have started travelling towards the east coast with only checking Quebec off my list I have visited, Montreal, and Mont Tremblant. I look forward to exploring the rest of eastern Canada and the Territories soon!
Below you will find a map of the major cities I have visited


<h4>Racing </h4>
<p>As an active member of the Ontario Off-road Racing Association (OORA) since 2010 I spend my spare time helping with promotion, graphic design, posters and more. I have been racing. I have been racing with OORA since 2010 and race the ½ 1600 class. Dune buggy racing is a fun active sport and shows an example of managed human interaction with ecosystems. I know most people wondered how a managed dirt sport could help have a lesser impact on local flora and fauna? Well, having managed areas for such sports creates less stress of people taking these vehicles to public land where fragile land could be destroyed.</p>
