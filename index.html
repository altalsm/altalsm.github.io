		<p> I love travelling and exploring new places! When I turned 18, 
I quickly moved away from Ontario and my hometown. I moved to Edmonton where I lived for 7 years. While living out west 
	I spent a lot of time travelling around the mountains exploring new hiking trails and hiking different ridges. 
	My favorite areas to camp and relax include Kananaskis and Nordegg, travelling off old logging roads on public 
	land are some of the best hidden gems away from the hustle and bustle of Banff and Jasper. I have also taken many 
	trips throughout British Columbia including places like Dawson Creek, Kelowna, Kamloops, Vancouver, Victoria, and 
	Tofino. After driving from Alberta to Ontario 6 times in the 7 years living out west, I have had the opportunity 
	of seeing and stopping in many cities on the prairies. 

Recently on my journey across Canada I have started travelling towards the east coast with only checking Quebec off my list I have visited, Montreal, and Mont Tremblant. I look forward to exploring the rest of eastern Canada and the Territories soon!
Below you will find a map of the major cities I have visited


		<h4>Racing </h4>
		<p>As an active member of the Ontario Off-road Racing Association (OORA) since 2010 I spend my spare 
	time helping with promotion, graphic design, posters and more. I have been racing. I have been
	racing with OORA since 2010 and race the ½ 1600 class. Dune buggy racing is a fun active sport
	and shows an example of managed human interaction with ecosystems. I know most people wondered 
	how a managed dirt sport could help have a lesser impact on local flora and fauna? Well, having
	managed areas for such sports creates less stress of people taking these vehicles to public 
	land where fragile land could be destroyed.</p>

		<h4> Hunting </h4>
		<p> As an active hunter I spend a lot of time during the year hunting. 
			As many know hunting is a very controversial topic in the environmental world, 
			but the realities are hunting supports conservation efforts by controlling species populations, 
			and 100% of the revenue spent on hunting and fishing in Ontario goes back into Fish and Wildlife Management. 
			With hunting as a hobby of mine my main hunting technique used is Archery hunting. Archery hunting is a discoursed 
			community on its own as it takes commitment, time, and skill. Unlike hunting with firearms, you must be able to get 
			a lot closer to your target without blowing your cover or the hunt is ruined. This involves more skills such as wildlife
			observing, tactical, accuracy, and attention to detail. I have been practicing the sport of archery for 10 years 
			and have applied my skills to the hunting community for 4 years. I started with archery when I was 13 on a school 
			trip. Right away I knew it was something I loved. I then continued to join the closest club being the East hill archery 
			club in Clarington, ON. When I was 15, I bought my first Bear archery compound bow which lasted me 4 years before 
			I upgraded. I then upgraded to the bow I use today which is an Excalibur compound bow. By the time I turned 18 I
			was very good at archery and decided to grab a hunting guide. My parents never supported hunting, so I never 
			investigated it. I never started hunting in Ontario as I moved to Alberta with my boyfriend who is now my fiancé 
			in 2013. When we moved to Alberta we applied for our tags and went on our first guided Mule deer hunt. 
			This was an experience of a lifetime and that was the moment when I knew I was apart of a community I was going to love. 
			Archery hunting identifies as a disclosed community as there are skills that set it apart from other communities. 
			Such as the use of archery equipment instead of firearms, or sport archery instead of archery hunting. All these categories 
			share traits, but they are all their own disclosed communities, and I am happy to be apart of the archery hunting community
